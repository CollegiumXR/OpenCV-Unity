OpenCV plus Unity

Originally created by Gobra

# OpenCV plus Unity
Its a wrapper for OpenCV precompiled libraries for most of the systems available in Unity
You can create projects that use the OpenCV capabilities in mobile projects and integrate custom AR solutions.

# Documentation 
OpenCV plus Unity original creator left the plugin some time ago and the website with documentation has been lost in internet
There is some way to recreate the documentation by just looking on the source code but it should be somewhat group effort.

## Build it Yourself
To run it in Unity Editor or Android you have to prebuild the libraries Yourself
